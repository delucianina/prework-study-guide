# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Homework assignment to make a study guide 

I made a study guide with some information about what I learned in my prework modules for my Bootcamp. This is intended to help bootcamp students with their homework. 

- Motivation: I wanted a refresher on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git/GitHub. 
- Why? I have made a basic website before but it's been a long time. I wanted to practice. Definitely not because this was a homework assignment. 
- This will help solve any issues that arise when I forget something about HTML and CSS down the line. 
- I learned how to link a JavaScript file to an HTML file. That was new for me! 

## Table of Contents 

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

N/A. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

For this project, just read the notes on the webpage if you forget something! 

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

N/A - I did not collaborate with anyone on this specific project. 

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

This project has an MIT license. Please refer to it in the repo.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
